            <p>Melewi is a remote-first UX & UI design studio. We breathe design. Having created awesome web & mobile designs for brands like McDonald's, Visa, Samsung, and Citibank, since 2012, we understand what our clients need. Through the years we've worked together with teams in huge international corporations, but also for early-stage startups, aiming to get a prototype out as quickly as possible. We've noticed that close to a 100% of the teams we work with come back for additional design work. Instead of having all those meetings for every new piece of design they needed and spending time to estimate it, we decided to create different monthly packages that contain specific amount of design hours. That way, our clients can choose a package, depending on the amount of design work they need per month. We call it Melewi Growth. Because good design makes your numbers go up! </p>
